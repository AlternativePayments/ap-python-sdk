== RUNNING APPLICATION

     Python 2.x:

        - Clone repo
        - Inside folder +sample_application/sample_application/ap_python_sdk_key.py+ set your account's public and secret keys
            eg. +ap_python_sdk.api_secret_key = 'Test/Live secret key provided in your Alternative Payments account'+
            +ap_python_sdk.api_public_key = 'Test/Live public key provided in your Alternative Payments account'+
        - Start Django server by runing +python manage.py runserver+ from inside folder +sample+
        - If your setup is default one then access application on +http://localhost:8000/app+

    Pyton 3.x:
        - Clone repo
        - Inside folder +sample_application/sample_application/ap_python_sdk_key.py+ set your account key
        - Because of https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0404/, you will need to change imports as follows:
            - app/urls.py: from `import views` to `from  app import views`
            - app/views/__init__.py: for all imports following example: from `from customers import *` to `from .customers import *`
            - sample_application/settings.py: from `import ap_python_sdk_key` to `from .ap_python_sdk_key import *`
        - Start Django server by runing +python manage.py runserver+ from inside folder +sample+
        - If your setup is default one then access application on +http://localhost:8000/app+
